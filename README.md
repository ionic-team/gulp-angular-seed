gulp-angular-seed
=================

A simple starting project for JS utilities that use Angular and want to build with Gulp


### Instructions

Edit the config in `config/build.config.js`

Put your code in `src/js/`

Modify `src/js/module.js` to change the name of your root Angular module. I recommend using the root module variable as a global instead of messing around with lots of hard-coded Angular module names.

Install dependencies with `npm install`

To build the project, run `gulp` and you'll find your unminified and minified JS files in `/dist`
